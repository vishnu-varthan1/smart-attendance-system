## 🚀 Project Overview

This system uses **computer vision + facial recognition** to automatically mark student attendance in real time. It replaces fragile manual systems and shuts the door on proxy attendance—for good.

Core goals:

* Accuracy over shortcuts
* Transparency over confusion
* Open-source over gatekeeping

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Student face registration
* ✅ Real-time face recognition via webcam
* ✅ Automatic attendance with timestamp
* ✅ Proxy attendance prevention
* ✅ Unknown face detection & alerts
* ✅ Admin dashboard for teachers
* ✅ CSV / Excel attendance export
* ✅ Manual attendance fallback

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

**Backend**

* Python (Flask)
* Flask‑SQLAlchemy

**Computer Vision**

* OpenCV
* face_recognition (dlib)

**Frontend**

* HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript

**Database**

* SQLite (simple, reliable, portable)

**Libraries**

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Pillow

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python **3.7+**
* Webcam
* 4GB RAM (minimum)

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-attendance-system.git
cd smart-attendance-system
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🧩 Dlib Installation (Critical)

Face recognition depends on **dlib**. Follow this verified guide:

🔗 [https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x](https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x)

### Common Fix (Windows)

* Install **Visual Studio C++ Build Tools**
* Install CMake
* Restart terminal (yes, really)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Common Issues

The most common installation failure is related to **`dlib`** and **`CMake`**. If you encounter errors like
`Failed building wheel for dlib`, follow the steps below based on your operating system.

### 🪟 Windows

1. **Install Visual Studio Build Tools**
   Download from: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
   During installation, select **“Desktop development with C++”**.
2. **Install CMake**

   ```bash
   pip install cmake
   ```
3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   Ensure **Python** and **Python/Scripts** are added to your *System Environment Variables*.

---

### 🍎 macOS

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. **Install CMake using Homebrew**

   ```bash
   brew install cmake
   ```

---

### 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

Install the required build tools and X11 development libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk-3-dev libboost-python-dev libx11-dev
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

### Automatic Mode

1. Register students (clear photos only)
2. Start camera
3. Enable face recognition
4. System auto-detects
5. Attendance marked

### Manual Mode

* Enter student ID
* Mark attendance manually
* Used as fallback

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

* Face encodings stored securely
* No raw biometric sharing
* Local‑only processing
* No cloud dependency

⚠️ **Ethical Note**: Deploy only with user consent.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

* 🔄 Multi‑camera support
* ☁️ Cloud database option
* 📱 Mobile app integration
* 🧠 Deep learning face models
* 🧾 Audit logs
